Personalized ToDo List: 
Create a basic ToDo list app where users can add and remove tasks. 
The app should display the list of tasks in real-time and provide simple interactions for adding and deleting tasks. 
Use Streamlit's st.text_input() for adding tasks, st.button() for submitting tasks, and st.write() for displaying the list.

Basic Data Visualization App: 
Create a simple Streamlit app that visualizes a dataset using a single plot type, such as a line chart or bar chart. 
Feel free to use a built-in dataset like Iris or Titanic from Seaborn, if you do not have your own. 
Focus on components like st.write() and st.pyplot() to display the visualization.

Text-Based Quiz App: 
Create a simple text-based quiz app where users can answer multiple-choice questions. 
Build a small set of questions and correct answers (perhaps do some fact-checking on Streamlit:). 
The app should display each question, allow the user to select an answer, 
and provide immediate feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect. 
Focus on st.radio() or st.selectbox() to present choices and st.write() to display feedback.
Try to deploy your app in the Streamlit community cloud. This one is a bit more advanced.
